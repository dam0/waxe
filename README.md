waxe
====

With waxe you can use the wxWidgets C++ library from Haxe for its neko or C++ targets.

All code is based on the official repo at:
http://code.google.com/p/waxe/,
the work of Hugh Sanderson (http://gamehaxe.com/)

I just added some missing pieces and hope I will continue to do so as time allows.
For a list of additions see the [Wiki page](https://github.com/mockey/waxe/wiki/Additions).
